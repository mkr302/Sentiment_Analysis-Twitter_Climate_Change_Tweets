# Sentiment Analysis - Twitter Climate Change Tweets

## Abstract
  
Sentiment analysis on global warming through social media discourse. The sentiment analysis revealed a balanced distribution of sentiments among Twitter users discussing climate change, with notable outliers expressing extreme opinions. These insights contribute valuable understanding of global warming's impact on different aspects and its societal implications.
  
## Problem Statement
  
We aim to conduct a sentiment analysis of Global Warming research presentations, exploring communication, interpretation, and potential external influences through social media discourse and other sources. By gaining valuable insights into the broader societal impact of global warming research, we aim to contribute significantly to the understanding and implications of this critical environmental issue.

## Initial Hypothesis
  
Our preliminary hypothesis on the sentiment analysis is expected to reveal a growing polarization of beliefs on social media platforms over time. We anticipate a prevalence of strong convictions and skepticism regarding global warming, shedding light on the evolving public discourse surrounding this critical issue.  

## Key Findings

The sentiment analysis of tweet messages in the Twitter data frame provides insights into the general mood towards climate change. Sorting the top 10 rows based on sentiment score reveals positive sentiments expressing support, enthusiasm, and agreement, while lower scores convey negative sentiments reflecting skepticism, denial, or criticism. However, acknowledging the complexity of sentiment analysis using NLP, some positive tweets may express disbelief, and negative tweets could support climate change. The scatter plot shows an even distribution of negative and positive sentiment tweets, with outliers representing extreme sentiment scores. This analysis offers valuable insights into sentiment distribution and complexities in capturing true sentiments, enhancing our understanding of public perceptions on climate change.
